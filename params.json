Given a list of gems, it can automatically download and install those gems, as well as any other gems needed by the gems that are listed. Before installing gems, it checks the versions of every gem to make sure that they are compatible, and can all be loaded at the same time. After the gems have been installed, Bundler can help you update some or all of them when new versions become available. Finally, it records the exact versions that have been installed, so that others can install the exact same gems.\r\n\r\n### Installation and usage\r\n\r\n```\r\ngem install bundler\r\nbundle init\r\necho 'gem \"rspec\"' >> Gemfile\r\nbundle install\r\nbundle exec rspec\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee [bundler.io](http://bundler.io) for the full documentation.\r\n\r\n### Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nFor help with common problems, see [ISSUES](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/ISSUES.md).\r\n\r\n### Other questions\r\n\r\nTo see what has changed in recent versions of Bundler, see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).\r\n\r\nFeel free to chat with the Bundler core team (and many other users) on IRC in the  [#bundler](irc://irc.freenode.net/bundler) channel on Freenode, or via email on the [Bundler mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-bundler).\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to contribute to Bundler, that's awesome, and we <3 you.
